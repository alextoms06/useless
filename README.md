## Project Description

A chatbot that acts as an argumentative AI partner, designed to debate and challenge user statements in real-time. It helps improve critical thinking through interactive conversation.

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People rarely have an AI partner that genuinely debates and challenges their opinions ‚Äî making conversations dull and unproductive.

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We created an AI chatbot that argues back, always challenging you, so you‚Äôre never stuck in a one-sided chat again. Who needs agreement anyway?
